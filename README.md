# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Technologies
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- GeoJSON
## Project Overview
Using earthquake data, we created a series of interactive maps showing the data points. The project is to be diplayed via a flask application. 
## Results
Here we see displayed a street map showing earth tictonic plate lines. Size and color of the circle markes the maganatude of the earth quake.

There is also a statlite view map for better visualization of the terrain and bioms in the effected areas.

And a dark map if you wished to only focuses on the marked data and not be distracted by the map.

Here we see an example of the popup informations showing the magnitude and exact location as described by the JSON data.

## Summary

GeoJSON is a powerful tool for displaying mapped data. This is a small example of what could be done, and how it's used. With this map we can visualize clearly that the entire western shore line of the Americas falls right on the meeting point between two tictonic plates. This would explain why it's such a regualar occurance in those areas.
